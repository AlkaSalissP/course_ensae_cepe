# course - Deep Learning
### What is this repository for? 
Notebooks and support necessary for the "Deep Learning" course. During the course, we'll apply together the studied notions (MLP, CNN, , Transfer Learning, RNN) on three practical cases: Mnist handwritten digit recognizer, cats vs dogs and IMDB critics. The solutions ([MNIST](https://github.com/HagopB/course_ensae_cepe/blob/master/notebooks/MNIST_CNN.ipynb), [Cats vs Dogs](https://github.com/HagopB/course_ensae_cepe/blob/master/notebooks/CATS_vs_DOGS.ipynb) & [IMDB](https://github.com/HagopB/course_ensae_cepe/blob/master/notebooks/IMDB_CRITICS.ipynb))are presented in the "./notebooks" folder. At the end of the course, you'll be asked to design and train your own model to solve an image recognition competition on kaggle [The Nature Conservancy Fisheries Monotirong](https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-nature-conservancy-fisheries-monitoring). A potential solution to this case is presented in this repo: [https://github.com/HagopB/fisheries_kaggle](https://github.com/HagopB/fisheries_kaggle).

### How do I get set up ?  
Install Anaconda 3
Import the conda environment named `deepenv` using : 
```
conda env create -f deepenv.yml
```

Activate that environment using :
```
source activate deepenv
```
Now all the dependencies must be installed without problems (Keras 2, tensorflow 1 ...)
